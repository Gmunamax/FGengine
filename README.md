**FGengine**


# INTRODUCTION

FGengine is a simple engine for my game "FG".


# PROJECT STATUS

This engine is in developement stage, so a lot of fuctionality for now doesn't exist yet. Also it means that existing fuctionality can be changed at any time, so be careful if you decide to use my engine now. Also, I'm not a professional, I'm only learning programming, so expect bad code, problems and other bad things, but I try to prevent this from happening.


# DEPENDENCIES

FGengine uses:
* SDL2
* OpenGL
* GLEW


# LICENSING

FGengine is an open-source software and licensed under the MIT License. Text of the license can be found in LICENSE file in this repository. Dependencies of FGengine are distributing under their respective licenses.
